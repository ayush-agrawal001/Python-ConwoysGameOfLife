# Conway's Game of Life

This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It initializes a 5x5 grid with random living and dead cells and evolves the grid based on the classic rules of the game.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python game_of_life.py
    ```

## Rules of the Game

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Future Enhancements

- Variable grid size
- Different initial configurations
- Optimized algorithms for larger grids
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
